TASK 5 : SALES PREDICTION

Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

This repository contains code and resources for implementing a machine learning model to predict sales using linear regression. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict sales based on various features such as advertising expenses, pricing, and other relevant factors.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical sales data along with corresponding features. The dataset includes variables such as advertising expenses (TV, radio, newspaper), pricing, and other market factors. The dataset allows us to explore the relationship between these features and sales and build a predictive model based on linear regression.
